This beautiful wedding dress has been worn once and then professionally cleaned.  There are NO stains, NO tears... appears brand new.  There are many details that make this the \"to die for\" wedding dress - intricate bead work on the chest and then scattered all down the dress, elegant lace overlay, form fitting through the hips and then fans out to accentuate a curvy figure, and a very sexy plunge back line. The dress can be worn strapless or spaghetti straps can be attached.  As seen from the pictures, this dress is perfect for ANY wedding - whether it be indoors or outside.
