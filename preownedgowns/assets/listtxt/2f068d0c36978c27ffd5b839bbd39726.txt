This isn't your generic style wedding dress that comes straight from a dress super store.  The champagne color and beautiful beading/lace details gives this dress a unique vintage feel. It's really beautiful in person and will get you tons of compliments. I wore it in my wedding, no stains, rips or tears. The dress has already been professionally cleaned and pressed after the wedding.  At the time of my wedding I was 5'7", wearing a size 8/10 in street clothes and had a 34D bust.
