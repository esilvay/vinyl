BRAND NEW NEVER BEEN USED. Remarkable. This gorgeous ball gown is a work of art. Layers upon layers of soft tulle work up to an intricate and beautiful lace sweetheart bodice with satin lacing in the back. Comes with white sash. This is the dress from the Bride Wars Movie....\r\nI am selling this dress for a month, then I will be moving out of the States. It was a non-refundable and I am choosing to wear a different dress I bought. This dress is perfect.
