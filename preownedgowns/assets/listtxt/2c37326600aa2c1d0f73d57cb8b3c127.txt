This dress is still sold by Nicole Miller and was purchased directly from the Nicole Miller Atelier in Beverly Hills, CA. It has been kept in a smoke free, child free, pet free house. It is still in the Nicole Miller clear plastic bag *inside* the official Nicole Miller garment...\r\nbag. There is *nothing* wrong with this dress! It is new; only tried on two times ??\" very carefully, at that ??\" after a shower without any make-up, hair product, perfumes, etc. on to ensure it stayed in perfect condition. It is super flattering with the empire waist and v-notch bust line. If you are a little hippy, it really has an amazing slimming effect by drawing the eye up. It looks AWESOME on very thin brides as well. When I was overanalyzing my dress options (admit it, we all doâ€¦) I Google images searched and surfed various photography blogs to see *real* brides in this dress and it seriously looks AMAZING on every body type.
